# Precise DUT Simulation Example

This example combines features from the "fast simulation" and the "TCAD field simulation" examples. The setup consists of six telescope planes of Timepix-type detectors for reference tracks and a device under test (DUT), in this case a CLICpix2 detector, in the center of the telescope between the two arms. The goal of this setup is to demonstrate how to perform a fast simulation on the telescope planes while maintaining a high precision on the DUT.

For this propose, the telescope follows the example of the "fast simulation" and employs a linear electric field and the `ProjectionPropagation` module for charge carrier transport. To assign this module only to the telescope planes, the `type` keyword is used to restrict the module to instances of Timepix detectors.

For the DUT the `ElectricFieldReader` module providing the TCAD field features the `name` keyword assigning this module instance to the DUT detector only. This named module instance takes precedence over the other instance with the linear electric field.
The `GenericPropagation` module also has to be assigned to the DUT because it would otherwise also be instantiated for the Timepix telescope detectors. Here, the `charge_per_step` setting has been reduced to 10 for the DUT since the CLICpix2 prototype features a sensor of 50um thickness and the additional precision might improve the agreement with data.

All further modules in the simulation chain are again unnamed and without type specification since they are supposed to be executed for all detectors likewise.
