# ROOT Analysis & Helper Macros

Collection of macros demonstrating how to analyze data generated by the framework. Currently contains a single macro to convert the TTree of objects to a tree containing standard data written by the framework. This is useful for analysis and comparisons with other frameworks.

### Comparison tree
Reads all required trees from the given file and binds their content to the objects defined by the framework. Then creates an output tree and binds every branch to a simple arithmetic type. Continues to loop over all events in the tree and converting the stored data from the various trees to the output tree. The final output tree contains branches for the cluster sizes, aspect ratios, accumulated charge per event, the track position from the Monte Carlo truth and the reconstructed track obtained from a center of gravity calculation using the charge values without additional corrections.

To construct a comparison tree using this macro, follow these steps:

* Open root with the data file attached like `root -l /path/to/data.root`
* Load the current library of objects with `.L path/to/libAllpixObjects.so`
* Build the macro with `.L path/to/constructComparisonTree.C++`
* Open a new file with `auto file = new TFile("output.root", "RECREATE")`
* Run the macro with `auto tree = constructComparisonTree(_file0, "name_of_dut")`
* Write the tree with `tree->Write()`

### Remake project
Simple macro to show the possibility to recreate source files for legacy objects stored in ROOT data files from older versions of the framework. Can be used if the corresponding dynamic library for that particular version is not accessible anymore. It is however not possible to recreate methods of the objects and it is therefore not easily possible to reconstruct the stored history.

To recreate the project source files, the following commands should be executed:

* Open root with the data file attached like `root -l /path/to/data.root`
* Build the macro with `.L path/to/remakeProject.C++`
* Recreate the source files using `remakeProject(_file0, "output_dir")`

### Recover Configuration Files
This macro allows to recover the full configuration of a simulation from a data file written by the ROOTObjectWriter module. It retrieves the stored key-value pairs and writes them into new files, including the framework and module configuration, the detector setup and the individual detector models with possibly overwritten parameters.

The simulation configuration can be recreated using the following command:

```
root -x 'recoverConfiguration.C("path/to/output/data.root",
                                "configuration.conf")'
```

Here, the first argument is the input data file produced by the ROOTObjectWriter, while the second argument is the output file name and path for the framework configuration. The detector setup and model files will be named as defined in the main configuration and are placed in the same folder.
